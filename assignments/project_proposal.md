# BIO490S - Methods Proposal

## Basic Details
Due: October 12, 3:00pm
What: Proposal of final project's methods
How: [Dropbox Submission](https://www.dropbox.com/request/2t3pgjqb51nABni4BBA1)

## Requirements
###Format
**.pdf only** 
No more than 2 pages (excluding Bibliography)
I have no preferred citation style, only the requirement that you cite in-text and include information that will allow me to easily find the paper
Include the location of your dataset in the text (e.g. n=12 fly samples, 6 from the hypoxic condition and 6 from the control (/work/cc216/490S/cc216/*.fastq))

### Content
Answer the following questions _(2 as a group, 3 individually)_:
1. What is your data (n=?) and has it data been downloaded? (Group) 
2. Have you picked software to handle/clean it? (Group)
3. What is your question?
4. What is your hypothesis?
5. Which software will you use?

### Grading Rubric

|Question|5 points|3 points|1 point|
|--------|--------|--------|-------|
|**1. Data**|Yes, they have been downloaded and are at the location listed|Some  but not all have been downloaded|No, they haven't or they're not at the location described in the text|
|**2. Group Software**|You've picked software that is appropriate and will allow you to take the output into a successful RNAseq analysis, software is appropriately cited|You've picked software that isn't appropriate or is insufficient to take the output into a successful RNAseq analysis, software isn't cited|No handling and cleaning software is mentioned|
|**3. Question**|Your question is clearly defined and is answerable by the data downloaded for your RNAseq analysis|Your question is not clear or the question you've defined is not answerable with the downloaded data|Question is not clearly defined|
|**4. Hypothesis**|Your hypothesis is clearly stated and is appropriate to your question|Your hypothesis is not clearly stated or isn't appropriate to the question you've defined|Hypothesis is not clearly defined|
|**5. Individual Software**|You've picked software that is appropriate and will allow you to test your hypothesis, additionally the software is appropriately cited|You've picked software that isn't appropriate or is insufficient to test your hypothesis, software isn't cited|No software is mentioned|

## Tips and Tricks
I wanted to provide some rough guidance here. I would recommend that you begin with the question and hypothesis, essentially a slimmed down version of an Introduction. Then describe the dataset, as a Methods section would, followed by the planned software. Together this should form the beginnings of a research paper as the Intro and Methods sections, though ultimately the Intro will need to be more thorough.
