# BIO490S - Rough Draft

## Basic Details
**Due:** December 14, 9:00am, _no extensions!_  
**What:** Your FINAL project, 100% complete  
**How:** [Dropbox Submission](https://www.dropbox.com/request/8vknFzWVyqjoCNHc4i1k)  


## Requirements
### Format
**.pdf only**
* Written solely in paragraph form, this should read like a paper
* No more than 8 pages, 1.5-spaced (excluding Bibliography and Appendices)
* I have no preferred citation style, only the requirement that you cite in-text and include information that will allow me to easily find the paper
* If you'd like to include information like file locations, please put them in an appendix (e.g. n=12 fly samples, 6 from the hypoxic condition and 6 from the control (see Appendix A).)
* You must have: Abstract, Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion and at least two figures

### Content
I will grade for the following content:

5 pts - **Abstract**        
10 pts - **Introduction**       
10 pts - **Methods**        
15 pts - **Results**        
20 pts - **Discussion**     
10 pts - **Figures**        
5 pts - **Grammar & Typos**     

Late work will be accepted **only between 9am and 12pm on December 14th** and penalized 15 points. _**If nothing has been turned in by 12pm December 14th I will grade your Rough Draft as your final project**_.

### Grading Rubric

|Content|Full Credit|Partial Credit|Nearly No Credit|
|--------|--------|--------|-------|
|**Abstract**|Your abstract is a single paragraph (roughly 4 sentences) that summarizes your question, hypothesis, methods, and results|Your abstract leaves out one or more of those four key ingredients|An abstract that is unclear, doesn't match the paper, or doesn't answer those four questions|
|**Introduction**|Your introduction introduces the reader to the biological system and question, what your hypothesis is and why you formulated it, and why this question is important|Your introduction fails to adequately present one of your system, question, or hypothesis|Intoduction is not coherent, doesn't present the question and hypothesis|
|**Methods**|Your methods section contains all the software that you've used, each is correctly described and implemented and the reader could replicate your work from the text, software is appropriately cited|Your methods section is lacking software, software is incorrectly described or implemented, or software isn't cited|No software is mentioned or there are other large gaps in the text that make it impossible to replicate your work|
|**Results**|Your results section succinctly describes pertinent results from all of the software packages you've used|The paragraph is lacking results from at least one software package|The paragraph lacks any and all specific results from your analysis|
|**Discussion**|Your discussion reiterates what your results mean and how they apply to your biological hypothesis, summarizes the overall findings of the research in addition to limitations of the work, and places those findings in the context of the system and the larger field of biology|Your discussion fails to do one (or more) of these key things: reiterate results with respect to your hypothesis, summarize findings, mention limitations and place the findings in a biological context|The paragraph fails to do all of the things|
|**Figures**|You have two plots which usefully describe your data, have clear figure legends and captions (which describe the plot) and are referenced in the text. One of the plots is novel and unique to your project (not a default from DESeq). Your figure titles and axes labels are correct|Your plots have unclear or incorrect labels, titles, captions, or legends or all figures are default outputs from DESeq|No figures or figures do not pertain to the biological question|
|**Grammar & Typos**|Your paper is free of typos and grammatical errors|Your paper has a few errors|Multiple errors or errors limiting effective communication and comprehension of the paper|

## Tips and Tricks
At this point bringing the project together is all about summarizing the biology and presenting a coherent narrative. Building off of your successful rough draft, the things left to do fall in two main areas: 1) analyze and present your results as they pertain to your hypothesis and 2) frame that hypothesis in the larger narrative of your system and biology. Analyzing the results can be broken down into a few smaller tasks. You should discuss the results as they relate to your hypothesis and present the data graphically in a compelling figure, beyond the default DESeq plots we discussed in class. You should also mention limitations of your study as well as potential future directions. Ultimately you should frame these results within the larger biological hypothesis you were testing and similarly the system within biology as a whole.
