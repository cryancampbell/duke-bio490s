# BIO490S - Methods in Computational Biology & Genomics

Instructor: C. Ryan Campbell
Email: [c.ryan.campbell@duke.edu](c.ryan.campbell@duke.edu)
Office: BioSci 311
Hours: 11am-1pm Fridays and by appointment

## Learning Objectives			
1. Teaching programming basics and best practices within a biology framework (i.e. basic building blocks for students to use biological software):
	* using command line interfaces
	* accessing supercomputers/clusters
	* building scripts
	* using biological programs (bwa, samtools, etc)

2. Teaching the statistics that underlie these tools and the rapidly evolving suite of measures used in "genomics".

3. Combine 1 and 2 to test biological hypotheses with RNAseq data, such as: what is the effect of hibernation (lemur), morph type (cricket), tissue type (crayfish), closing mechanism (venus flytrap), and salty ecotypes (cotton) on gene expression across the tree of life.

## Prerequisites
- One of BIO201/202
- STA101 or higher OR BIO204
- Some coding background (computer language independent)

## Diversity
As an instructor I will endeavor to promote diversity of all kinds in this course and in the greater University commmunity as a whole. This includes, but is not limited to, the selection of photos for my teaching slides, the intentional usage of "they" as a third-person singular pronoun (so as not to assume gender) and the identification of outstanding scientists who are not white, cis-gendered, heterosexual men. I will bring up these issues in class as often as is appropriate to the material and will always be open to dicussing them outside of class.
